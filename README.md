# FORTRAN-Exercises
Fortran exercises for the course of Computational Methods A at UnB.

These exercises were submitted as a requirement for the course of Computational Methods A at UnB during the first semester of 2019. Brief description of each one below:

03-derivada.f90 - Calculates derivatives via the first order method.  
04-integral(4).f90 - Calculates integrals via the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule and Gaussian quadrature rule. Also compares the three methods.

07-kummer(1).f90 - Computes Kummer's function.  
08-hipergeometrica(5).f90 - Computes the Hypergeometric function, includes limiting cases for comparison.  
09-gama_func_final_corrigido.f90 - Computes Gamma function.  
10-aproximacoes_sucessivas(2).f90 - Computes roots via the method of successive approximations.  
11-newton-raphson2.f90 - Finds solutions of a system of equations via the Newton-Raphson method.  
12-euler-modificado(2).f90 - Approximates derivates via Euler's method.  
12-taylor(3).f90 - Evaluate a function at a point via the Taylor series method.  
13-df.f90 - Finds solutions for a system of equations via the finite differences method.
